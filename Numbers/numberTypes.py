# Three types of numbers
    # Integers
x = 1
    # Floats
x = 1.1
    # Complex
x = 1 + 2j

# Standard arithmetic operations
    # Addition
print(10 + 3)
    #  Subtraction
print(10 - 3)
    # Multiplication
print(10 * 3)
    # Division (2 types)
print(10 / 3)   # Floating point
print(10 // 3)  # Whole number
    #  Modulus
print(10 ** 3)  # Exponent, less left to the poser of right

# Augmentet assignment operator
x = 10
    # Increment by 3
# x = x + 3
    # Or (Uncomment each)
# x += 3
# x -= 3
# x *= 3
# x /= 3
